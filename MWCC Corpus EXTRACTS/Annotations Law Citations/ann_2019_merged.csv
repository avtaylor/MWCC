It provides as follows: l) When a person is charged with an offence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete a minor and cognate offence, and such combination is proved but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of the minor and cognate offence although he was not charged with it. 2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor and cognate offence, he may be convicted of the minor and cognate offence although he was not charged with it. An alternative verdict in compliance with section 150(1) should be entered where no injustice will be occasioned against the accused especially. There is, however, nothing unconstitutional with making an alternative verdict under sections 153 to 157 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code since the alternative offence will have been proved, and this should raise nothing contentious. I have perused through the case of The Republic v Raphael Banda Criminal Review Case No. 7 of 2017 where the lower court convicted the convicts of the offence of attempted burglary when they were originally charged with attempted robbery in disregard of section 151 (2) (b) and 151 (5). The two offences do not fall under section 150 of the Code so as to call the latter case minor and cognate. They are distinct offences and therefore you cannot substitute attempted burglary for attempted robbery. Further, they do not fall under sections 153 to 157 of the Code so as to regard them as alternative offences. As such, the substitution required the new charge to be read out for the accused person to take plea. The third ground of review is in respect of jurisdiction of sergeant to prosecute criminal cases.

Sections 161 A-J of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code do not bar prosecution of crimes. Sections 161 A-J of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code only and clearly limit how long a person should be in custody before commencing proceedings. They create, where the State wants to prosecute a person while in lawful custody, a duty to commence the proceedings within the maximum time limits or the statutory extended time. Sections 161 A-J of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code require that the State apply for extension seven days before expiry of the pre-trial custody time limit. It limits the accumulation of further extensions. Once these times are exceeded, like in England (and Wales), the Court can extend time, unlike in England (and Wales) under the Prosecution of Offences Act and the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limit) Regulations, for a further 30 days only. If the custody time limits are exceeded, the Court must release the prisoner with or without bail, if the trial has commenced."

On the first issue of whether the learned magistrate erred in law by taking age to be an element for the offence of indecent assault on a female the appellant argues that the magistrate misdirected himself by taking age of a girl to be an element of the offence of indecent assault when the magistrate stated in his ruling that 'the elements of the case are that, the girl be aged 16 years and that the accused indecently assaulted her'. The appellant correctly submits that the section under which the ofTence of indecent assault on a female is provided for does not have age as an element of the offence. While the respondent agrees with the prosecution that the offence o! indecent assault under section 137(1) of the Penal Code is not age specific he contends that subsection 2 of section 137 is irrelevant in this case as at no point did the respondent plead consent as a defence. The respondent is of the view that the lower court did not regard age as a necessary element of the offence. The respondent submits that if age was regarded as an element, which he submits was not the case, the said error was of no consequence since the respondent's acquittal was based on the lack of evidence for the assault itself therefore age could not affect the conclusion of the court."

However, as admitted by the Appellant's counsel, you do not need to rely on the medical report to prove penetration. In some instances the medical report is tendered by the police investigator and once the medical report is admitted in evidence, the case may suffer serious evidential damage as the investigator did not examine the victim girl and so cannot be cross examined on the veracity of the report. In this case, a medical officer, Dr Gugulethu Mapurisa testified that he/she examined the victim and found bruising on the vaginal wall and found that the vaginal membrane was not intact suggestive of penetration and sexual abuse. Even if the medical report was made inadmissible, the oral evidence of the medical officer would be proper evidence to prove penetration. I would also wish to agree with the State that the issue of admissibility of the medical report should have been objected to at the earliest opportune time in the proceedings bearing in mind that the Appellant was represented by counsel before the report was admitted into court to form part of the prosecution evidence. This is a situation where I would apply section 5(2) of the Code, that its admission did not occasion any failure of justice since the medical doctor testified in person and was subjected to cross examination. This case was based on circumstantial evidence from which one can justify an inference of guilt if the prosecution establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the facts are incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of any reasonable explanation (Nyamizinga v R [1971-721 6 ALR (Mal) 258). In Mehta v R (1961-63) ALR Mal. 363 Southworth J (as he then was) in explaining circumstantial evidence stated as follows: ' ...The burden of proof resting on the prosecution goes beyond setting up a preponderance of probability and requires the Crown case to be established beyond all reasonable doubt; and that when the Crown case rests upon circumstantial evidence...the court must...be sure there are no other co-existing circumstances which would weaken or destroy the inference [drawn from the evidence].

This statement by Denning, J was approved by Smith, Ag. J. in the case of Rep —v- Banda (1968-70) ALR Mal. 96 at p. 98. It is therefore the duty of the State or prosecution to prove each and every element of the offence of murder.

For the accused persons to be found guilty of murder therefore, the prosecution must establish or prove through evidence, that the accused persons by an unlawful act or omission, caused the death of the deceased person; and that they did so with malice aforethought. As regards proof of availability of malice aforethought, section 212 of the Penal Code gives the following guidelines: ""Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence proving any of the following circumstances- (a) An intention to cause the death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (b) Knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused; (c) An intent to commit a felony; In order for the state to prove its case against the accused persons, it must therefore be established that the accused persons had the requisite intention to cause the death of the deceased or to do him grievous harm. This can be established by direct or indirect evidence (circumstantial evidence). Most often times it is difficult to prove a charge through direct evidence, and the State most often times will rely on circumstantial evidence. In the case of R —v- Taylor (1928) 21 Cr.

As regards proof of availability of malice aforethought, section 212 of the Penal Code gives the following guidelines: ""Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence proving any of the following circumstances- (a) An intention to cause the death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (b) Knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused; (c) An intent to commit a felony; In order for the state to prove its case against the accused persons, it must therefore be established that the accused persons had the requisite intention to cause the death of the deceased or to do him grievous harm. This can be established by direct or indirect evidence (circumstantial evidence). Most often times it is difficult to prove a charge through direct evidence, and the State most often times will rely on circumstantial evidence. In the case of R —v- Taylor (1928) 21 Cr. App. R 20 Hewart, C.J had this to say:"
judg_2019_17,er_pm,27,section 176 of the Criminal Procedure & Evidence Code,1277,1330,"""But as was acknowledged in the case of Nyamizinga v Rep 6 ALR Mal 258 a conclusion of guilt will only be acceptable from circumstantial evidence if that conclusion is the only one to be had from the said evidence. So that if the circumstantial evidence is capable of being explained other than by the guilt of the accused then a finding of guilt is not sustainable. In the matter at hand, the prosecution has relied on circumstantial evidence. There is no witness who saw the accused persons cause the death of Joseph Kachingwe. Furthermore, the body of the said Joseph Kachingwe was never recovered. Regardless of the body not being found, it does not mean that the accused persons cannot be convicted of murder. If the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that they caused the death of Joseph Kachingwe this court would be at liberty to convict them. It is prudent that at this moment I must deal with the issue of the caution statements tendered herein. The ISt accused contends that his caution statement was not freely given. He even showed the court scars on backside which he claimed were occasioned by police beatings. In other words, he is retracting his caution statement. The 2nd accused only alleged that her statement was not read over to her. I am mindful of section 176 of the Criminal Procedure & Evidence Code which provides as follows: ""s. 176 —(1) Evidence ofa confession by the accused shall, if otherwise relevant and admissible, be admitted by the court notwithstanding any objection to such admission upon any one or more of the following grounds (however expressed) that such confession was not made by the accused or, if made by him, was not freely and voluntarily made and without his having been unduly influenced thereto. (2) No confession made by any person shall be admissible as evidence against any other person except to such extent as that other person may adopt it as his own.

He was run over by a motor vehicle, probably a big one since he was discovered with intestines gaping outside. He sustained injuries to the head and fractures of both legs and the right arm. On this very night, the accused met one John Michael (PW 1), a businessman who sold chickens and goats. He told the court that he bought a goat from the accused persons at KI, 500.00. In the course of selling him the goat, the accused persons told him that they had assaulted someone with a panga knife and they had left him unconscious. The assault was because the deceased had asked them about the goat. Eventually, all evidence led to the conclusion that this was the only man attacked on that night who ended up being run over by a vehicle. They were convicted accordingly. When sentencing, the court must consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Mitigating factors speak well for the accused person and will often lead to the court exercising lenience on him. Aggravating factors speak against the accused person and will lead the court to pass a more severe sentence from what normally it would be. Penal sections in Malawi provide for maximum sentences. Sentencing practice is clear that only worst offenders deserve maximum sentences. Ordinarily, imposition of a sentence more than half of the prescribed maximum sentence is not usual. However, in deserving situations, courts may sentence one beyond half the maximum sentence. In Ayami v Rep [1990] 13 MLR 19 the court stated that in considering the appropriateness of the sentence, it is imperative to evaluate the extent of the crime, the effect on the victim (or victims) and the circumstances in which it was committed, and come up with a sentence which is appropriate in that particular case. Sentence must befit the offender in that it should not be manifestly on the lower or higher side, and that the court should take into consideration the mitigating factors that may avail the offender.

The statement above puts the Malawi Supreme Court of Appeal in concord with the Kafantayeni case (supra) justifying why courts should exercise their discretion in determining on the appropriate level of punishment in murder convictions which is a judicial function. It is not surprising that section 210 amendment of the Penal Code is couched in that manner so as to retain the courts discretion in determining sentence in murder convictions. The interpretation by the courts and the law today are in tandem, which is a good thing. Hence, in practice, the convict is given the opportunity to be heard on sentence which was not the case before. The requirements of the Constitution are thus also fulfilled. Malawi has retained the death sentence but has done away with it being mandatory. Courts should therefore not shun imposing death sentences under the pretext that they are inhuman, cruel and that they affect human dignity. It has been reiterated that there will be times when death sentence shall be unavoidable due to the circumstances and that it should be reserved for such occasions. Courts are aware that death sentence should not be the first option unless the State strongly supports it and there is nothing else the court can do in the circumstances, but to impose it. There should always be compelling circumstances or reasons for the court to ultimately agree with the State and impose the death sentence.

They gave up and left with a few properties such as home theatre and blanket. She then informed her neighbour who told the police who came to collect the body. In a desperate bid not to lose out on the house and the car in the pending divorce judgment which the convict was certain would not be in her favour, she hired the other accused persons to overpower the deceased so as to enable them to get away with the car unimpeded by him. Her version after a guilty plea was that the other accused persons assailed the deceased person and tied him up with wires to disable him. They took the car keys and left the deceased and the convict in the room. She further stated that after the other accused persons left the room, the deceased, in his drunken stupor, rose up and started shouting at her that he was aware of everything she had done to him. The deceased then lunged at her. She reached for a shovel which was in the bedroom and hit the deceased on the head with the shovel, then held his neck in a strong chokehold until the deceased went limp in her arms. During that time the other accused persons were attempting to drive away with the deceased's car, but after failing to do so, they returned to the bedroom and found the deceased lying on the floor after having been assaulted by the convict. The accused persons were frustrated that the car could not be driven away and demanded that the convict find a way to recompense them for their efforts there and then. The accused persons then went ahead and appropriated several household items from the convict's home. They then assisted the convict with putting the accused's body in a sack. When sentencing, the court must consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Mitigating factors speak well for the accused person and will often lead to the court exercising lenience on him. Aggravating factors speak against the accused person and will lead the court to pass a more severe sentence from what normally it would be. Penal sections in Malawi provide for maximum sentences.

Counsel has further questioned the involvement of PW Ill when the complainant's husband was available. It is in PW Ill's evidence that the complainant is his sister. It wouldn't be surprising therefore, that he was actively involved in trying to secure the release of the complainant on bail. Counsel has strongly argued that the Appellant's conviction is not safe as there was no corroboration of the fact that PW Ill gave money to the Appellant. It must be noted that except in situations where corroboration is required as a matter of law or practice, an accused person can easily be convicted on the evidence of a single witness. Section 212 of the CP&EC provides as follows: ""Subject to this Code and any other law for the time being in force, no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. "" Thus, it is possible to prove the guilt of an accused person just on the evidence of one witness. The offence under s.24 of the CPA does not require corroboration.

A submission of case to answer means that a reasonable tribunal, properly directing its mind to the law and the evidence, could convict if no explanation is offered by the defence (see Criminal Procedure &Evidence Code in Malawi by David Newman). The court in R -v- Dzaipa [1975-771 8 MIR 307and DPP -v- Champhonda [1973-741 7 MLR 94 followed The Practice Direction of Lord Parker as to the meaning of prima facie as follows: ""A submission that there is no case to answer may properly be made and upheld: a) When there has been no evidence to prove an essential element in the alleged offence; or b) When the evidence adduced by the prosecutor has been so discredited as a result of cross-examination or is so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict upon it... The decision should depend not so much on whether the adjudicating tribunal (if compelled to do so) would at that stage convict or acquit but on whether the evidence is such that a reasonable tribunal might convict. If a reasonable tribunal might convict on the evidence so far laid before it, there is a case to answer. "" Facts of the case are that PW2, wife to the deceased went out at night to empty the chamber pot when a person wearing a hood grabbed her and started beating her. The hood went off and she claims to see the face. The suspect was in dread locks. She identified the suspect in his dread locks. She screamed for help and when the husband who was drunk came out she was unconscious. The attacker continued to attack the husband who was badly injured and was taken to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital here he died. Pw2 was also admitted at the hospital. She revealed to police investigators that the suspect she saw lived at Nyirenda's place in Chilomoni. Mr Nyirenda admitted knowing the suspect but that since the night of the incident the suspect surprisingly had not been seen at the house. When the court inquired PW2 said that she had not seen the suspect in 15 years and that she did not know him before and that she saw him for the first time on the night of the attack.

I have noted that this matter has been referred to as Criminal Appeal Case No. 43 of 2018 and also as Criminal Review No. 43 of 2018. The mix up starts from the Summons for Review/Supervision which are registered as Criminal Appeal Cause Number 43 of 2018 as drawn by the Applicant. Counsel for the Applicant should have been vigilant to capture such errors at an early stage to avoid wastage of time. I was lenient enough to accept it pass but to my chagrin. Because the Summons were taken under section 25 of the Courts Act, I considered it as Summons for Review and I proceeded as such. Hence, the grounds of Appeal became the grounds of review. I should have loved it if the application was commenced as an appeal though. The State proceeded as if it was a criminal appeal matter yet the Applicant clearly outlined his grounds of review in his skeleton arguments. However, the interest of justice will not suffer in anyway which ever route we take. I warn counsel once again to be vigilant when preparing documentation so as to avoid such confusions. The grounds of review as follows: l) The conviction was made on a non-existent charge as the Appellant was convicted of robbery when the charges were theft, causing grievous harm and malicious damage. 2) There was no evidence that the Appellant stole a flash diski, a modulator and the sum of MK46, 000. 3) There was no evidence that Roy Makumbi was injured/suffered grievous harm, and that if he was, that the harm was caused by the Appellant. 4) There was no evidence that a motor vehicle registration number SA 4073 Toyota Surf Station Wagon was damaged, and if it was, that the damage was done by the Appellant. The Appellant was arrested on 27th November, 201 7 and was taken to court on 1st December, 2018 where the State asked for more time to investigate the case. It was adjourned to 1 lth December, 2018.

Complex cases, however, will justify delays longer than those acceptable in simple cases. Systemic and institutional delays will also weigh against the Crown. When considering delays occasioned by inadequate institutional resources, the question of how long a delay is too long may be resolved by comparing the questioned jurisdiction to others in the country. The comparison of similar and thus comparable districts must always be made with the better districts, not the worst. .. ..certain actions of the accused, on the other hand will justify delays. A waiver by the accused of his rights will justify delay, but the waiver must be informed, unequivocal and freely given to be valid. "" I agree with the views stated above. However, I am working on the basis of this case being in the category of complex cases which require intense preparation. Hence, the stand that I have I also observe that if the accused were discharged under section 247 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code, the State which has demonstrated that it is ready to proceed with prosecution would recommence the case again rendering the discharge a futile exercise. This would not portray proper and prudent management of the case. Time is of the essence and therefore we should avoid processes that would be time wasters. In this regard, this court accepts the notice of Preliminary Objections by the State and order that we proceed to hear the case on the present set dates of 1st- August to 7th August 2019."
