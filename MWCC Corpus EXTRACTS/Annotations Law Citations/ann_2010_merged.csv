judg_2010_17,er_pm,12,Section 254 of the Penal Code,1034,1063," I have considered the submissions made by both Counsel and I wish to commend them for their valued submissions. I have noted the distinction Counsel for the State has drawn between the facts of the present case from those in the case of Chikwekwe v Republic Criminal Appeal No. 76 of 2005 where Chipeta J, reduced the sentence of 18 months Imposed by the lower court to 9 months on the grounds that while in the Chikwekwe case there was no evidence of the wound having been sutured, there was evidence that the wound had been sutured in the present case. I understand Counsel as arguing that this meant that the wound in the present case was more serious than in the Chikwekwe case and that as such the Appellant in this case deserved a stiffer sentence than the Appellant in the Chikwekwe case. While I entirely agree with Counsel for the State in her argument it is to be appreciated that the Appellant in the Chikwekwe case had a previous record of conviction for the offence of Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to Section 254 of the Penal Code and yet the Appellant in the present case has no record of a previous conviction whatsoever. This fact would in my view militate in favour in reducing the sentence against the Appellant in this case. To maintain a sentence of 12 months imprisonment with hard labour for a first offender when an offender with a previous conviction was able to go away with only a 9 months' sentence for a similar offence would in my considered view not be fair. I thus reduced the 12 months' sentence to 9 months. The sentence is to take effect from the date of the conviction by the lower court."

judg_2010_22,er_pm,14,Section 16 provides in,17,39," the Republic in Section 16 provides in no uncertain terms that the right of every person to life shall not be deprived arbitrarily. It is thus unconstitutional and wholly unjustified for anyone to take another man's life away on petty reasons as was the case in this action. It is my considered view that if the accused felt greatly injured by the insults showered on his wife he COUId have opted for other remedies available at law than assault the deceased in the manner he did. There is, no doubt, real need to deter would be offenders against such unlawful acts as would result in the loss of human life. I thus agree with State Counsel that a stiff sentence ought to be imposed in this case. I also agree with State Counsel that the change of plea made by the convict in this case after more than 4 years from the time of the commission of the offence when all along he had been denying responsibility cannot be regarded as evidence of remorsefulness on the part of the accused. If indeed the accused was remorseful he should have admitted responsibility for the offence at the earliest opportunity than he has"

Although the learned judge in that case was not dealing with an application for bail pending an appeal, but an order for stay pending an appeal, he nevertheless made an illuminating statement on the point under consideration. What had happened in that case was that the applicant was charged in the First Grade Magistrate's Court at Thyolo, with causing death by dangerous driving contrary to Section 123(4) of the Road Traffic Act. He was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of MK160.00 and was disqualified from driving for four years. He applied to the magistrate for an order staying the operation of the order of disqualification pending the determination of his appeal against conviction and sentence. The application was refused on the ground that staying the order was not mandatory. He subsequently made a similar application to the High Court. It was submitted on his behalf that (a) the power to stay the order of disqualification was discretionary and it did not appear that the magistrate had exercised the discretion judicially (b) for 1 1 months since the making of the order the applicant had been driving without committing any further offence (c) he had previously been driving for nine years without conviction. In view of (b) and (c) it was argued that he was not a menance on the roads and should be permitted to drive pending the determination of the appeal. The state opposed the application in principle on the ground that the applicant had not shown that any exceptional and unusual circumstances of hardship would arise if the order were put into effect immediately. The court held that the operation of an order of disqualification from driving will only be stayed pending an appeal if exceptional and unusual circumstances of hardship to the applicant are shown. Such circumstances may be the court's belief that the appeal will succeed in its entirety and the likelihood that it cannot be disposed of within a reasonably short time. The court further held that there is"

It was also further argued that the applicant was a man of many business activities and had many affairs which required to be would up and the case was one of great complication and it would be useful if the applicant could have free access to his legal advisers in the preparation of his appeal.

judg_2010_30,er_pm,43,Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code,985,1040,"However, it should also be borne in mind that justice is a double edged sword and that when it comes to criminal matters, justice must not only seen to be done but that it must be done. This is especially in view of the fact that an accused person has a right to a fair trial, which actually denotes that he should be given an opportunity to properly defend himself against the charges that have been brought against him. The question thus becomes was the appellant given an opportunity to defend himself against the charge that he corruptly solicited a bribe in order to grant Judith Muloti and her husband bail? We think not, because the right to a fair trial also requires that an accused should be informed, with sufficient particularity [emphasis mine] of the charge against him. In this instance we do not think that there was sufficient particularity since there was a misconstruction in the particulars of the offence. Indeed unless and until the court the court decides under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code that the charge should be amended and then call upon the accused to take a fresh plea on the amended or altered charge, it is bound to proceed with the charge as proffered. This is especially critical in cases where the intention of the accused is key in arriving at a conviction. This is of course not saying that it would be right for a police officer to solicit a bribe so as to forego and investigation into an allegation. All I am stating in this case is"
judg_2010_30,er_pm,45,Section 90(a) of,665,681,"Now in order to resolve this issue I must note that whilst as there was a misconstruction in the charge, the facts that were presented before the court were that the appellant asked Judith Muloti's husband for some money so that he can release the latter on bail. However, as earlier noted, and it is well settled, that police bail is supposed to be free such that if a police officer would request money from a suspect so that the suspect should be released on bail, then it can be safely be assumed that the said officer made such a request so that he can use the money for his own benefit and thus the police officer would be guilty of Official Corruption under Section 90(a) of the Penal Code.

In this regard, I did note from the record of the lower court that when he was asked about the money, the appellant seemed to admit that he had indeed collected money from the complainant's husband but he was not sure that he had given it back. Indeed whilst it is allowed for police officers to remove from the person of a suspect some personal effects including money, these are supposed to be properly recorded so that when the person is released from custody they should be given back. Thus surely if the appellant had indeed taken money from the complainant for safekeeping, he should have kept a record of the same but most importantly he should have been able to remember. In the final analysis, then it is observed that much as the finding on the lower court was not based on the charge as proffered. The finding was based on the evidence that was adduced before the lower court and the law. Further, it is noted that the appellant had the opportunity to hear such evidence and then enter his defence. Indeed much as it is not clear that as to whether the Appellant was the most senior police officer at Mtambanyama Police Unit or not, it is quite clear that he was the only officer on duty at the time. In this regard, the charging of Judith Muloti and her husband for the offences of assault fell within his duties. Further, it was also within his duties to release the Appellants unconditionally when it became clear that the complainants of the assault charge were not going to pursue the case any further. Thus the fact that the Appellant did ask for money in order to release Judith Muloti's husband would make him guilty of the charge of official corruption contrary to Section 90(a) of the Penal Code. In this regard, I must then state that the lower court was not wrong in arriving at the decision that it did. It is therefore with these views in mind that I would conclude that there was no miscarriage of justice which was occasioned in the trial of the Appellant in the lower court which would necessitate that I should order a new trial on the charge of official corruption. It is thus in this regard that I will proceed to confirm that conviction on the first count of official corruption and dismiss the appeal against the same. Having dismissed the appeal against the conviction on the charge of official corruption, I must now address the issue of the sentence. In this regard let me begin by making the observation that anyone who has been found liable of the offence of official corruption as provided for in Section 90(a) of the Penal Code is guilty of a felony and shall be liable to imprisonrnent for a term of not less than five years and not more than twelve years.

That intention to cause grievious bodily harm -falls within the definition of malice aforethought on contained in Section 212 of the Penal Code.

However, in my judgment the decision whether or not this Court should set aside the conviction metted on the Appellant very much depends on whether the Appellant was materially prejudiced by the succeeding Magistrate's failure to re-summon the witnesses or to inform the Appellant of his right to re-summon the witnesses. Having perused the Record of the proceedings in the lower court very carefully I am of the considered view that the Appellant was not materially prejudiced by such a failure. The conviction of the Appellant in the lower Court having been grounded on the evidence of PW2 and PW3 which evidence the Appellant failed to controvert by failing to cross-examine the said witnesses the re-summoning of the witnesses would thus have been a mere waste of time or resources. The fact that the Appellant did not challenge these two witnesses in their averment that the Appellant took away the clothings PW2 was wearing leaving her only with a petticoat and a pant which in turn compelled PW2 to rush to the clothes she had been washing, was sufficient basis for a finding of guilt on him.

The statement is made should be calculated or likely to incite or induce and that the use of the word calculated or likely is very significant in that the word means that the Prosecution can either prove the calculation or the likelihood and it satisfies that element.

judg_2010_6,er_pm,3,section 329 of the Penal Code,204,233,BACKGROUND The accused was charged together with one Matembo Munthali of the offence of Being Found in Possession of Property Reasonably Suspected of Having Been Stolen or Unlawfully Obtained contrary to section 329 of the Penal Code. After a full trial he was convicted and fined K5000.00 in default 12months IHL. The co- accused was acquitted. The matter was urgently set down to consider the propriety of the conviction.
judg_2010_6,er_pm,7,section 329 abovementioned generally,227,263,THE CONVICTION Our understanding of the conviction is that the court below was convinced beyond doubt that the convict was inter alia found in possession of ten coupons and secondly that the said court found nothing wrong with section 329 abovementioned generally and applied to this our case. It is those very issues that we address in this opinion.
judg_2010_6,er_pm,9,section 21 of the Constitution,2397,2427," evidence that the convict was not present when Matembo's house was being searched in the same way that Matembo was absent. Having excluded the results of such search against Matembo we would have thought the same should have been done in respect of the convict. But that notwithstanding we think with the greatest respect that the court below got the wrong end of the law relating to possession in so far as it applied to this our case. The commonly understood view of possession is that one should be in physical possession of the item(s) in issue. In the alternative the items in issue should be at a place over which the accused has control. The seven coupons were found at Matembo's house. This is a house occupied by more than one person at any given time. One would think that the court below should have acted with caution before it concluded that the coupons belonged to this or that particular occupant of the house. But perhaps more importantly it is important to note that the convict never actually lived in that house. Matembo and some of the witnesses did. If anything the convict was at most a regular visitor to the house. Did that warrant the court below to find that the seven coupons were the convict's? The answer has to be in the negative. As we understood its thinking the court below felt that because the ten coupons in issue clearly came form one book, because they clearly were (in its view) stolen and because the convict had been found with the other three then the conclusion must be that he knew something about all of them; that he must be said to be or have been in possession of all ten of them. In so far as the seven were concerned the court below fell into error. Like we have said above, and like the said court itself said in respect of Matembo, the search was an illegal one. Its result could not therefore be allowed in evidence. In much the same way that they were excluded in respect of Matembo we think they should have been excluded against the convict. To the extent therefore that the court below based its decision on the fruits of the search such a decision cannot stand. We should say at this point however that the matter of illegal searches goes beyond mere illegality. In today's constitututiinoal dispensation it is a matter of human rights, respect for the law and the defense of the constitution. See the right to privacy as provided for in section 21 of the Constitution. Further and again as we say above, it is obvious that the convict cannot be said to have had, at the material time, exclusive control over the room in which the coupons were found. At law it cannot be said therefore that he had possession of the coupons seeing as they were in Matembo's house. They could have been Matembo's. They could have been the property of any one of the persons who lived in that house. Our conclusion therefore has to be that as a matter of fact the court below erred in concluding that the seven coupons found in Matembo's house belonged to or were in the possession of the convict. Regarding the three coupons found with Malange we are prepared to find that they were at all material times in possession of the convict. After all despite the fact that Malange had physical possession of them it was at all times subject to the superior property rights and sanction of the convict. We shall therefore"

Whether or not section 329 was constitutional or not. Its view was that the section is perfectly constitutional. That all it requires from a suspect found with property reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained is an explanation on a balance of probabilities that such is not in fact the case. That the burden it places on the accused is nothing more than an evidential burden. We differed with the State. As we understand the law the Constitution grants one the right to remain silent or to speak in one's defense. It also gives one the right to refuse to give a statement the effect of which will be to incriminate oneself. See section 42 of the Constitution. Those rights are available without discrimination to all accused persons. A section 329 suspect on the other hand does not have such choice. Once the powers that be make their mind that she must have stolen or illegally obtained whatever property he has in his possession it behoves her to explain on the pain of a conviction that he has innocent possession of such property. That in my view goes beyond mere evidential burden. That goes into the realm of coercion. Whatever explanation the accused gives therefore is one that is extorted from him for fear of being found guilty of an offence under section 329 of the Penal Code. That sounds to us like discrimination. In other words that section 329 has in practice the effect of treating differently identically placed suspects. Whereas others are allowed to keep quite others are coerced to speak. But perhaps more than that we have no doubt that the explanation sought from the accused is in fact a disguised way of asking the accused to prove himself innocent. So that if one is less than adept at doing so he might be found guilty irrespective of the fact that he might actually be in innocent possession of the property in issue That is unconstitutional. See the case of Jumbe and Mvula referred to above. On a different note we always like to think this kind of penal provision is a lazy way of fighting and/ or dealing with crime. Rather than try and find out whether or not the suspect is in innocent possession they dare the suspect to prove herself innocent. That is not how it should be. It is for the law enforcement agencies to prove that a suspect is in illegal possession of property either because they have stolen the same or because of some other illegality. And if the suspect has stolen the property the correct way forward is not to proceed under section 329 but to charge the suspect with theft and prove it. It is not to allow them to get some conviction of the suspect through the backdoor when they can not get one through the front door by allowing them to bring forward a section 329 prosecution in the hope that the suspect will fail to explain herself.

Whether or not section 329 was constitutional or not. Its view was that the section is perfectly constitutional. That all it requires from a suspect found with property reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained is an explanation on a balance of probabilities that such is not in fact the case. That the burden it places on the accused is nothing more than an evidential burden. We differed with the State. As we understand the law the Constitution grants one the right to remain silent or to speak in one's defense. It also gives one the right to refuse to give a statement the effect of which will be to incriminate oneself. See section 42 of the Constitution. Those rights are available without discrimination to all accused persons. A section 329 suspect on the other hand does not have such choice. Once the powers that be make their mind that she must have stolen or illegally obtained whatever property he has in his possession it behoves her to explain on the pain of a conviction that he has innocent possession of such property. That in my view goes beyond mere evidential burden. That goes into the realm of coercion. Whatever explanation the accused gives therefore is one that is extorted from him for fear of being found guilty of an offence under section 329 of the Penal Code. That sounds to us like discrimination. In other words that section 329 has in practice the effect of treating differently identically placed suspects. Whereas others are allowed to keep quite others are coerced to speak. But perhaps more than that we have no doubt that the explanation sought from the accused is in fact a disguised way of asking the accused to prove himself innocent. So that if one is less than adept at doing so he might be found guilty irrespective of the fact that he might actually be in innocent possession of the property in issue That is unconstitutional. See the case of Jumbe and Mvula referred to above. On a different note we always like to think this kind of penal provision is a lazy way of fighting and/ or dealing with crime. Rather than try and find out whether or not the suspect is in innocent possession they dare the suspect to prove herself innocent. That is not how it should be. It is for the law enforcement agencies to prove that a suspect is in illegal possession of property either because they have stolen the same or because of some other illegality. And if the suspect has stolen the property the correct way forward is not to proceed under section 329 but to charge the suspect with theft and prove it.

judg_2010_6,er_pm,13,Constitution,543,555,"The convict together with his coaccused made several applications for bail in the trial court. They were refused. The thinking of the trial court from what we could gather from its record was that the convict and his friend had shown no exceptional circumstances on the basis of which bail could be granted. Further that since the police were still carrying on with their investigations it was proper that bail be declined. The trial court fell into error. It emanates from treating bail as a right which it is not. Rather bail as used in the Constitution refers to the condition(s) on which one is released. Because bail was treated as a right the trial court thought, correctly maybe, that every right is limitable. The correct way to approach a request for bail when used to mean a release from detention pending a hearing of one's case in our view is to treat, as does the Constitution in section 18, liberty as a right so that when one is incarcerated that is tantamount to a limitation by the arresting authority, in this case the State, of such right. And like in all cases of limitations it is then the duty of the one limiting the liberty to show, on a balance of probabilities, that such limitation is in accordance with section 44(2) of the Constitution. Applied to this case once the convict and his coaccused were brought into court on remand it would have been the duty of the State to show why they should not be released with or without bail and NOT for the convict to show exceptional circumstances why he should be released from custody with or without bail.

The present case, when it was in the Court below, involved a total of five Accused persons.

Having been so registered, I further notice that in due time, i.e. on 13th July, 2009, it was perused by a Review Judge in Chambers, who directed it to be set down for a hearing in Open Court as follows: ""Set down to consider the propriety of the sentences- are they custodial sentences, fines or fines in default? The Magistrate seems confused. "" Opportunity for the directed confirmation hearing to take place, it appears, never really came up. This is because as the lower Court was preparing to refer the matter to the High Court for review, within a fortnight or thereabouts of the lower Court pronouncing its sentences in the matter on 6th June, 2009, one of the Accused persons in the case, i.e. the first in the set of the five Accused, on 23rd June, 2009, though M/S Winlaw & Ndau, lodged an appeal against both the convictions he got on three Counts in the matter, and against the sentences that were imposed on him. As a result of this development, the same case, with him alone as Appellant, and with the Republic as Respondent in the Appeal, was opened. His said appeal ended up being registered as Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2009. I further notice that a week later, on 30th June, 2009, through M/S Ralph and Arnold Associates, a second Notice of Appeal, reflecting all five Accused Persons as appealing against the whole judgment in the case, was filed. The Appeal record, however, continued to reflect only the person who had been first Accused in the Court below as the sole Appellant in the case. M/s Ral h and Arnold Associates eventually by Notice of Appointment dated and filed on 16tl November, 2009, placed themselves on record as Legal Practitioners for this sole Appellant.

While the said Notice of Appeal carried a set of six Grounds of Appeal, that seek two reliefs, i.e. (i) the quashing of the Convictions the Appellant got, and (ii) the consequent setting aside of the sentences that accompanied the convictions, in arguing the Appeal, the Appellant condensed all those Grounds of Appeal into two only. The two questions that now sum up all of the Appellant's Grounds of Appeal are (a) whether at the trial the Prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant did commit the offences he was convicted of, and (b) whether the Prosecution in fact proved beyond reasonable doubt that in fact the offences charged were committed."

judg_2010_9,er_pm,33,Section 4 of the Penal Code,440,467,"I need also to mention here and now that while reasonable time was devoted by the parties to arguing the Ground of Appeal concerning whether the offences involving personal injury (i.e. Assault and Grievous Harm) were actually proved in light of the manner Medical Reports in their respect were tendered in the Court below, and on account of the question whether the said Medical Reports were capable of proving Grievous Harm as defined in Section 4 of the Penal Code, I will only address that Ground, if the need to do so remains outstanding, towards the end of my Judgment. It dawns on me at the moment that in a scenario where the first question posed for my consideration relates to a wider concern on the Appellant's part i.e the question whether at all the Prosecution did satisfactorily prove both his presence at the scene of crime, and his involvement in the commission of the crimes he was convicted of ,questions such as whether the evidence presented established Grievous Harm as legally understood are secondary, and they only become relevant depending on how the question whether there is a connection between the offence(s) and the alleged perpetrator of the same is resolved. To in advance, therefore, dwell on questions such as whether the Medical Reports on record were properly tendered, and what probative value their contents had, before the question whether the Prosecution sufficiently connected the Appellant to the crimes he is complaining he has been wrongly convicted of is resolved, could easily be the equivalent of placing the cart before the horse. My initial focus in dealing with this Appeal, therefore, will be on the Grounds of Appeal that are summed up in the question whether the Prosecution in this case did prove, to the requisite legal standard, the fact that the Appellant committed the three offences he was convicted of."
judg_2010_9,er_pm,46,Section 42 of the Constitution of Malawi,371,411,"The inference the lower Court so drew from the prima facie case test it quoted from the Chidzero case is, from a Criminal Procedure point of view, far from correct. In fact, I feel obliged to say, it is also a potentially dangerous view for a Court to hold vis-å-vis the proper exercise of the right to fair trial, which embodies the right to silence, which by virtue of Section 42 of the Constitution of Malawi, Accused persons ought to enjoy without restraint in every Court of Law. Carried to extremity, its meaning would be that once an Accused has been found with a case to answer, he/she cannot safely exercise his/her right to silence without risking a conviction, because, according to the understanding of the Court below as depicted in its inference herein, a Court is entitled to assume that it can convict an Accused purely on basis of its having earlier found a prima facie case against him or her, unless, as that Court seems to suggest, he/she fights that finding adequately. Really, if the position of the Law were as so surmised by the lower"
judg_2010_9,er_pm,56,the Law on Criminal Cases,330,355,"With the greatest respect to the learned Court, its said expectations from the Appellant when he embarked on his defence were tantamount to saddling him with a burden of proof the Law does not place on shoulders of an Accused person in a Criminal Case involving most Defences, including that of an alibi. The constant position of the Law on Criminal Cases in general, I must reiterate, is (i) that the Accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty, (ii) that proof of guilt is the duty of the accuser, and that the degree of proof must reach highly demanding levels far beyond just hanging around preponderances of probability, and (iii) that the Accused does not, in the least, shoulder any obligation to prove his innocence. Statements in a Judgment, therefore, tending to the effect that once a Court has put an Accused on his defence, then the onus is on him or her to fight through adequate explanation against the trend of events so as to turn them from a possible conviction to an acquittal, as the lower Court is on record to have made in this case, inherently suggest that to the extent it championed that view, the lower Court openly demonstrated that contrary to the above established legal principles it was expecting the Appellant to prove himself innocent, and that therefore merely raising a reasonable doubt about his guilt was not going to help him at all, as it was definitely not going to meet with the Court's expectations."
