Secondly intoxication is a defence if it was caused without the consent of the person charged and by the negligent or malicious act of another. Thirdly intoxication is a defence if it causes temporary insanity and the onus to prove this point lies on the accused.

The particulars were that the Appellant on about the night of 14 December, 2009 at Vinthukutu Agriculture Offices broke and entered into a government office and stole therein a motor cycle with registration No. MG 820 and two crush helmets worth K509, 000.00 properties of the Government of Malawi. The Appellant pleaded not guilty, and after a full trial, he was found was guilty, convicted and sentenced to 6 years imprisonment. Being unsatisfied with the decision of the court below, he now appeals to this court against both conviction and sentence."
judg_2011_2,er_pm,6,section 311 of the Penal Code,184,213, Skeletal Arguments. Mr. Christon Ghambi from Legal Aid Chambers representing the Appellant was of the strong view that the State had failed to prove the elements of the offence under section 311 of the Penal Code beyond a reasonable doubt. That the evidence was circumstantial which could not warrant a conviction. He prayed to Court to quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. In the alternative he prayed to Court to reduce the sentence of 6 years for being excessive.
judg_2011_2,er_pm,16,section 311 of the Penal Code,38,67,Law and Evidence. The charge is under section 311 of the Penal Code which states as follows:- Any person who —
judg_2011_2,er_pm,21,section 311 of the penal code,641,670,PW2 stated that on the material day at around 9:45 pm while it was raining and while the lights had gone off he went outside his house. While there he saw two people struggling to push a motor cycle. He noted that one of them was tall and he suspected it was the Appellant since he is also tall. He did not see the faces of these two people. The evidence as presented indicates that the offices were broken into and one motor cycle was stolen. This means there was a breaking into a government office and while inside the thieves committed the felony of theft and broke out. This is not in dispute. The fact that a crime was committed under section 311 of the penal code has been proved. The question before me is who was/were responsible for the offence?
judg_2011_2,er_pm,26,section 187(1) of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code,207,265,It is trite that in this matter the State was duty bound to prove each and every element of this offence and the standard required by the criminal law is beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant provision is section 187(1) of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code.

The fact that someone was on night duty as a guard and things go missing does not in itself make him responsible. There must be other independent evidence connecting him to the crime. The proper charge against the Appellant if indeed he was a night guard was negligence by a public officer in preserving money or other property belonging to the government which was under his control or custody under section 284 of the Penal Code."

That consideration in my judgment is not very crucial when sentencing for burglary or housebreaking. The legislature, in creating the offences of burglary and housebreaking, wanted to proscribe trespass on dwelling house with intent to commit a felony. The crime is complete when there is trespass and entry as the Penal Code defines with intent to commit a felony irrespective of whether the crime is committed or not. It may be necessary in some cases when sentencing for burglary or housebreaking to consider the fact whether the felony was committed. That is unnecessary where, as happened here, the offence committed in the course of the burglary or housebreaking, is subject of a separate count. There is prospect of double punishment. In the circumstances where that the offence was committed is a necessary consideration, the sentencing court must avoid leaving the impression that for an offence complete according to the law, a man should escape the appropriate punishment simply because he did not commit the offence he intended to. The legislature, as it did with breaking into a building and committing a felony therein, never created a compound crime. It proscribed breaking and entering into a dwelling house with intent to commit a crime. It matters less that the offence was not committed."

This Court hold suspect a cash sale of property suspected to have been unlawfully obtained is doubted if the one who produced it is unwrilling to help the police trace it to the one who issued it. The onus remains on the accused to provide evidential burden as to physical identification of the seller. Since the cash sale is prima facie conclusive evidence of sale, this court would like to add that where the seller can not be traced, the cash sale loses its conclusiveness and the property suspect. In section 237 of the CPEC it is provided that when a party has refused to produce a document which he has had notice to produce, he can not afterwards use the document as evidence wQhout the consent of the other party or order of the court.

As the position stands, I for one would believe that in this case the Third Grade Magistrate proceeded to assume jurisdiction on the basis that the offence charged is somehow listed in the Second Schedule as one of offences over which he could assume jurisdiction. In my considered opinion, this is understandable to a large extent; and in the narrow context of the experience and regard to the strictures of analysis of the law a Third Grade Magistrate is expected to possess. However, s. 13 (3), being part of the principal Act, overrides the Second Schedule. Nevertheless, I will uphold the magistrate's assumption of jurisdiction on the basis that the charged offence is listed in the Second Schedule. From that narrow perspective, the Third Grade Magistrate properly assumed jurisdiction over the matter. But, for the avoidance of doubt, and for future guidance to subordinate courts, magistrates of the third grade should not assume jurisdiction over an offence if the penalty provided for that offence exceeds their prescribed jurisdiction under s. 14 (4) of the Code; even if the offence is somehow included"

The lower court erred in finding that there was rape According to section 132 of the Penal Code rape is having sexual intercourse with a girl or woman without her consent or where the consent is obtained by force or means of threats and intimidation. The Complainant explained in her evidence that the Appellant actually pushed her into the bedroom then he pushed her to the floor, pushed her underwear to one side then forced himself on her. These are, without doubt, circumstances indicative of lack of consent. As held in the case of R v Kaluwa that penetration, use of force and absence of consent are essential to prove rape. The question that must now be answered is whether it was the Appellant that committed the said heinous crime."

This offence is similar to the offence of theft in the instant case. And looking at the length of the period between the previous conviction and the current conviction one WOUId be inclined to hold the view that the previous conviction has not had any effect on the Appellant. The Appellant thus, no doubt, deserves a stiffer penalty.

judg_2011_52,er_pm,6,section 176 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code,933,988," 481. Mere suspicion, no matter how strong it rnight be, is not enough to justify a conviction. There must be cogent evidence implicating the accused. In this case, the evidence suggests that there were a lot passengers in the minibus and surely the mere fact that the appellant was identified by PW 1 as one of the passengers because of the remarks he made about the stench, without any evidence of his involvement in the robbery, would not be enough to meet the required standard of proof to justify his conviction otherwise all the other passengers would equally be culpable. I would therefore find and hold that the basis on which the lower court convicted the appellant was faulty and erroneous. It may be argued that the appellant's conviction should still stand as, apart from the evidence of PW l, he was implicated by the 3rd accused, Evance Mikoko, in his confession statement. The law is the very clear as provided for in section 176 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code that a confession statement is only admissible as against its maker. It can only be admissible against another if that other person adopts it as his own. There is no slightest indication in this case that the appellant at any point adopted or purported to adopt the confession allegedly made by the 31 d accused. Most significantly, the 3rd accused in his defence evidence retracted or disowned the confession implicating the appellant. He said in his evidence that he did not know all the other accused persons before the allegation in this case arose. He denied having mentioned any of the other accused persons in his caution statement. In the light of the foregoing, I would, in the end result, find and hold that the evidence before the lower court in so far as it relates to the appellant did not reach the required legal standard to warrant his conviction. I would consequently uphold the appeal against the appellant's conviction and accordingly quash it and set aside the sentence that was imposed."

Then a fight broke out between the two and when they inquired they were informed that the two were fighting in connection with some K 15. Musoda then took some K 15 and gave it to the accused. It was not long after this fight ended that PW 2 saw the accused fighting with the deceased. He did not ask why they were fighting. The he heard the deceased saying that he had been stabbed but he did not, at that moment, state who had stabbed him. It was later when the police came that the deceased stated that it was the accused who had stabbed him. It was his testimony that he saw neither a knife nor the stab wound. He said he knew who had stabbed the deceased because the deceased had said so himself. He also said that soon after the alleged stabbing the accused ran away.

In addition whereas PW 1 said he actually saw the accused person stabbing the deceased with the knife, PW 2, although he did not see either the knife or the witness the actual stabbing, he said he heard, at that moment, the deceased complain that he had been stabbed by the accused. PW2 did say, during cross-examination that he heard from the owner of the drinking place that the accused had stabbed the deceased. If this had been his only basis for his taking the position that it was the accused who stabbed the deceased, I would have dismissed his testimony as hearsay. He however, upon further questioning, said that this was in addition to his own witnessing of the stabbing. Further as soon after as the deceased had been so stabbed the accused sneaked away from the scene, pretending at first to go to the toilet, and then hurriedly walking away. I would think that the accused behaved in this manner upon realising the wrong which he had committed and its seriousness. Then when recording his statement under caution with the police, the accused admitted that he is the one who stabbed the deceased. He of course purported to retract his said admission of the offence, during the hearing, alleging that he was coerced into doing so and that the other suspect, Malizani, was released under questionable circumstances. I have given these allegations appropriate considerations and formed the view that they lack substance and as such decline to give them any weight. Then lastly but not least, the deceased himself, according to the evidence, complained during the fight he had with the accused, that he had been stabbed, and as I have already said, since it was only the accused who was close to the deceased, and fighting with him, it can only be the accused who must have stabbed him and caused his death.

The Company rented a house from a Mr. Kumwenda for K90 per month. Grain and Milling headquarters issued a cheque for K270 payable to Mr Kumwenda to cover rentals for three months and this cheque was sent to the NIzuzu office where it was received by the accused. However instead of giving the cheque to Mr. Kumwenda, the accused endorsed the words: 'pay Grain and Milling Mzuzu' on the cheque and proceeded to cash it.
